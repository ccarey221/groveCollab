After looking over the dataset, I noticed there are no patterns to make an algorithm faster than O(n). Fortunately, because Latitude and Longitude degrees, minutes and seconds are equivalent (except close to the poles, but in a negligable way), we can calculate distance from a given location based on the delta of the latitude and longitude.
